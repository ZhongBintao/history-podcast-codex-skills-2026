# Podcast Production Agent Version

`podcast-production-agent-version` is a subagent-first rewrite of the original podcast production plugin.

The only user-facing skill is:

```text
podcast-series-showrunner
```

After the user confirms the series concept, season plan, and fixed opening voice, the showrunner collects production readiness information and creates one standard task packet per target episode. Each episode subagent owns only its own `episode_dir`; the main agent owns validation, status reporting, and `production_state.json`.

The complete spoken sequence is:

```text
fixed opening_voice.wav -> episode greeting in narration.txt -> episode body -> preview/farewell closing -> goodbye
```

## Key Behavior

- `podcast-series-showrunner` is the only core skill.
- One episode is produced by one episode subagent.
- Multiple episodes may be produced by multiple episode subagents in parallel.
- Subagents must not modify `production_state.json`.
- The main agent validates outputs and updates `production_state.json`.
- Real DashScope credentials must stay in `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`; task packets and manifests may reference only the environment variable name.
- Each episode's `narration.txt` starts with a natural host greeting after `opening_voice.wav` and before the episode body.
- Non-final episodes close with a light next-episode preview and goodbye; final or single-episode series close with a series farewell and goodbye.

## Production Readiness

Before dispatching episode subagents, the showrunner confirms:

- `series_dir`
- episode number(s) or range
- whether to generate audio, default `true`
- whether `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` is available in the environment
- whether `opening_voice.wav` exists
- whether to force `fact_check.md`

## Included Scripts

Run from this plugin root:

```text
scripts/cosyvoice_ws_tts.py
scripts/robust_episode_tts.py
scripts/build_episode.py
scripts/run_episode_pipeline.py
scripts/validate_production.py
```

Episode subagents normally use:

```bash
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="$DASHSCOPE_API_KEY" python3 scripts/cosyvoice_ws_tts.py \
  --narration /absolute/path/to/episode/narration.txt \
  --out-dir /absolute/path/to/episode \
  --output-prefix voice \
  --manifest-name tts_manifest.json \
  --model cosyvoice-v3-flash \
  --voice longsanshu_v3 \
  --send-mode combined \
  --max-chars-per-task 10000 \
  --chunk-silence-ms 0 \
  --tail-silence-ms 3500
```

Then:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_episode.py \
  --opening-voice /absolute/path/to/series/opening_voice.wav \
  --voice /absolute/path/to/episode/voice.wav \
  --out-dir /absolute/path/to/episode \
  --episode-slug episode
```

Finally:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_production.py --episode-dir /absolute/path/to/episode
```

`scripts/run_episode_pipeline.py` is retained for main-agent controlled deterministic runs. It updates `production_state.json`, so it is not the default subagent command.

`fact_check.md` is optional.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`
- Python package `websockets`
- `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` for audio generation
